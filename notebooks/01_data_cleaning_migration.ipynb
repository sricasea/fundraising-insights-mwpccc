Project Overview\n\n### 1.1 Objective\nThis project was initiated to solve a long-standing gap in donor tracking and fundraising analysis at Mt Washington Preschool and Child Care Center (MWPCCC), a 501(c)3 non-profit childcare organization in Los Angeles. Despite over 30 years of operations, donor information was scattered across spreadsheets, accounting software, and in situ operational software. Without a centralized system, outreach efforts were inconsistent, and data-driven decision-making was impossible.\n\nTo address this, I structured and cleaned donor data in Google Sheets, implemented unique donor IDs, automated reporting with Google Apps Script, and prepared the dataset for migration to PostgreSQL for deeper analysis.\n\n### 1.2 Tools & Technologies Used\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **Google Sheets** | Main data repository before migration |\n| **Google Apps Script** | Automating ID generation, data aggregation, and anonymization |\n| **Excel** | Data formatting, duplicate removal, and validation |\n| **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** | Cleaning and standardizing text data |\n| **Data Validation & Dropdowns** | Standardizing entries to minimize errors |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Initial Data Challenges\n\n### 2.1 Challenges in Data Consolidation  \n\nBefore structuring this data, donor and fundraising records were **not stored in a centralized location**. Instead, they were scattered across:  \n\n- **Procare (Childcare Management System)** â€“ Contained **some** parent contact data but was inconsistently formatted across reports.  \n- **QuickBooks (Accounting Software)** â€“ Held **financial transaction records** but had no direct links to donor names or engagement history.  \n- **Mailchimp (Email Marketing Platform)** â€“ Provided **limited engagement history**, but only for donors who had been sent email campaigns.  \n- **Personal Contact Lists** â€“ Some donor information was recovered through personal knowledge and outreach.  \n\n**Rebuilding the Dataset:**  \nBecause of these limitations, the process required:  \nâœ… **Manually linking contact details** across platforms to ensure donors were correctly identified.  \nâœ… **Reconstructing donation histories** where records were missing or incomplete.  \nâœ… **Using judgment calls** to group donations under `GivingEntityID` when no direct match existed.  \n\nThis project was not just about cleaning up a messy dataset â€” it was about **forensic data reconstruction** from scattered sources. The final structured version in Google Sheets allowed for **accurate tracking, automation, and ultimately a successful migration into PostgreSQL for analysis.**\n\n### 2.2 Goals for Data Structuring\nâœ… **Standardize formatting** for all donor details.  \nâœ… **Implement unique GivingEntityID** to track donations by individuals, families, or corporate entities.  \nâœ… **Automate donation tracking & aggregation** to remove manual work.  \nâœ… **Ensure data integrity** before migrating to a PostgreSQL database.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Data Structuring Process\n\n### 3.1 Sheets & Column Standardization\n**Key Sheets Created:**\n1. **Master Donor List** â€“ Unique GivingEntityID, contact details, total donations.\n2. **Individual Donors** â€“ List of individuals tied to their respective GivingEntityID.\n3. **Corporate Donors** â€“ Similar to Individual Donors but for businesses or foundations.\n4. **Donations** â€“ Each donation entry, linked to an individual and a GivingEntityID.\n5. **Fundraisers** â€“ Tracks the success of each fundraising event.\n6. **Fundraising Costs** â€“ Tracks the cost of each fundraising event.\n7. **Summary Sheet** â€“ Aggregated donor data for reporting.\n8. **Processed Data** â€“ Prepared dataset for generating mailings and reports.\n\n### 3.2 Creating Unique Identifiers (GivingEntityID)\nImplemented a **Google Apps Script** to generate a **GivingEntityID** that:\n- Groups individuals by shared address and family ties.\n- Ensures that donations by a family are aggregated properly.\n- Distinguishes between individuals, families, and corporate entities.\n\nâž¡ **[View Full Script Here](/work/Scripts/AssignGivingEntityIDs.js)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction assignUniqueGivingEntityIDs() {\n  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(\"Master Donor List\");\n  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();\n  var idCounter = 1000;\n  \n  for (var i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {\n    if (!data[i][0]) { // Column A = GivingEntityID\n      data[i][0] = \"GE\" + (idCounter++);\n    }\n  }\n  sheet.getDataRange().setValues(data);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Automation with Google Apps Script\n\n### 4.1 Matching Donations with Donors\nThis script ensures that each donation is correctly linked to a `GivingEntityID`.\n\nâž¡ **[View Full Script Here](/work/Scripts/populateDonationGivingEntityIDs.js)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction populateDonationGivingEntityIDs() {\n  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();\n  var donationsSheet = ss.getSheetByName(\"Donations\");\n  var masterSheet = ss.getSheetByName(\"Master Donor List\");\n\n  var donationsData = donationsSheet.getDataRange().getValues();\n  var masterData = masterSheet.getDataRange().getValues();\n\n  var donorMap = new Map();\n  masterData.slice(1).forEach(row => {\n    donorMap.set(row[2], row[0]); // Match Primary Contact to GivingEntityID\n  });\n\n  for (var i = 1; i < donationsData.length; i++) {\n    var donorName = donationsData[i][2];\n    if (donorMap.has(donorName)) {\n      donationsData[i][0] = donorMap.get(donorName);\n    }\n  }\n  donationsSheet.getDataRange().setValues(donationsData);\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 Other Utility Scripts\nThese scripts perform smaller tasks that support the core automation:\n\n- **[Populate GivingEntityIDs](/work/Scripts/PopulateGivingEntityIDs.js)** â€“ Ensures all donor sheets are linked to the `GivingEntityID`.  \n- **[Generate Unique Donation IDs](/work/Scripts/populateDonationIDs.js)** â€“ Assigns unique IDs to donations for tracking.  \n- **[Log Fundraiser Costs](/work/Scripts/updateFundraiserCosts.js)** â€“ Stores costs associated with each fundraiser.  \n- **[Calculate Profit from Fundraisers](/work/Scripts/updateFundraiserProfits.js)** â€“ Calculates `Total Raised - Costs`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Anonymization for Public Sharing\nSince donor data contains **sensitive information**, a script was written to replace real names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers with **randomized but structured placeholders.**\n\nâž¡ **[View Full Script Here](/work/Scripts/anonymizeData.js)**\n\n---\n\n## 6. Impact & Results\n### 6.1 Improvements Achieved\n| Issue | Before | After |\n|-------|--------|------|\n| Data Consistency | Inconsistent names & formats | Standardized formatting via scripts |\n| Tracking Donations | Manual entry | Automated using IDs & formulas |\n| Duplicate Donors | Same donor appearing multiple times | Unique `GivingEntityID` implemented |\n| Mail Merge Prep | Manual formatting | Auto-generated mailing lists |\n\n### 6.2 Key Takeaways\n- **Google Sheets is powerful** but requires structure for effective data management.\n- **Automation reduces errors** and saves hours of manual work.\n- **Unique Identifiers are critical** for linking donations, fundraisers, and donors.\n- **Anonymization enables data sharing** without privacy concerns.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Next Steps & Migration to PostgreSQL\nWith the cleaned and structured dataset, the next step was **migrating this data into PostgreSQL** for:\nâœ… **Advanced querying & reporting** using SQL.  \nâœ… **Improved data integrity** with relational database constraints.  \nâœ… **Faster insights** via optimized queries.  \n\nðŸ“Œ **See the PostgreSQL migration & reporting project here:** [Data Migration and Analysis Report](https://deepnote.com/workspace/puddles-7d469830-b020-4998-9332-fad683944541/project/Welcome-d50b48dc-8b60-4e72-885a-59c1190a91a3/notebook/Data-Migration-and-Analysis-Report-870451d5ae6d45a5bca1bd2f825144ae?utm_content=d50b48dc-8b60-4e72-885a-59c1190a91a3)\n\n","block_group":"3921588162be432c8fcdddc25a0cd16e"}],
