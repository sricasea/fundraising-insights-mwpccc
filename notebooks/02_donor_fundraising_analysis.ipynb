Objective\n\nThis report analyzes historical donor and fundraiser data to evaluate the effectiveness of fundraising efforts for MWPCCC. By leveraging a structured PostgreSQL database, we assess **donor engagement trends, fundraising performance, and overall financial sustainability**.\n\nKey areas of focus include:\n\n1️⃣ **Total fundraising revenue over time** – How much has MWPCCC raised annually?  \n2️⃣ **Fundraiser effectiveness** – Which types of fundraisers generate the most revenue?  \n3️⃣ **Donor retention & behavior** – Are donors giving repeatedly, or is engagement declining?  \n4️⃣ **Large donor impact** – How reliant is MWPCCC on a few high-value donors?  \n5️⃣ **Predictive insights** – What trends can guide future fundraising strategies?  \n\nWhile a full break-even analysis requires additional financial data from QuickBooks and ADP, current trends indicate that recent fundraising efforts have not been enough to sustain MWPCCC. This report aims to identify gaps and opportunities in donor engagement and fundraising strategy to support future financial planning.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Data Sources\n\nThis report is built using structured fundraising and donor data migrated from Google Sheets into PostgreSQL. Data sources include:\n\n- **Donor Records:** Originally compiled from Procare, Mailchimp, and manual records. Now structured into a centralized database.\n- **Fundraiser History:** Historical records from internal documentation, detailing revenue, costs, and participation.\n- **Donation Tracking:** Transaction-level donation data, aggregated by donor and fundraiser.\n\nAll data has been **cleaned, standardized, and structured** to allow for reliable trend analysis and reporting.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Data Migration Process\n\nTo ensure consistency and accuracy, we implemented a **structured data migration process** from Google Sheets to PostgreSQL. This process involved:\n\n### 3.1 Extracting & Cleaning Data\n- Removed duplicate and inconsistent records.\n- Standardized donor names, addresses, and donation formats.\n- Anonymized sensitive donor information for privacy.\n\n### 3.2 Structuring Data for PostgreSQL\n- Designed relational database schema with tables for **Giving Entities, Donations, Fundraisers, Fundraiser Costs, and Occupants**.\n- Established primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.\n- Addressed data inconsistencies and errors during the upload process.\n\n### 3.3 Data Upload & Validation\n- Converted Google Sheets data into CSV format for batch uploads.\n- Used SQL scripts to import and validate records in PostgreSQL.\n- Implemented automated checks to verify data accuracy post-migration.\n\nThis structured approach ensured that historical donor and fundraising data could be queried efficiently, enabling deeper insights and trend analysis.\n\n### 3.4 Tools & Technologies Used\n\n- **Google Sheets** – Initial data collection and organization.\n- **Google Apps Script** – Automation for data structuring and cleaning.\n- **PostgreSQL** – Database for storing structured donor and fundraising data.\n- **pgAdmin** – Database management and SQL query execution.\n- **Deepnote** – Data analysis and project documentation.\n- **Python** – Used for advanced data processing and visualization.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Database Schema & Structure\n\nThe database schema was designed to efficiently store and query fundraising and donor data while maintaining referential integrity.\n\n### 4.1 Tables & Relationships\n\n| Table Name | Description | Primary Key | Foreign Keys |\n|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **giving_entities** | Stores family, individual, and corporate donor entities | `entity_id` | None |\n| **occupants** | Tracks individuals associated with a giving entity | `occupant_full_name` | `entity_id` |\n| **donations** | Tracks each donation, linking it to a donor and fundraiser | `donation_id` | `entity_id`, `fundraiser_id`, `occupant_full_name` |\n| **fundraisers** | Records details of each fundraiser event | `fundraiser_id` | None |\n| **fundraiser_costs** | Logs expenses associated with fundraisers | `cost_id` | `fundraiser_id` |\n\n### 4.2 Constraints & Integrity\n- **Primary Keys**: Each table has a unique primary key to ensure data integrity.\n- **Foreign Keys**: Relationships between donations, fundraisers, and giving entities ensure proper linking of transactions.\n- **Validation Rules**: The data migration process included checks for missing fields, duplicate entries, and incorrect formatting.\n\n### 4.3 Lessons from Data Upload Failures\n- Several errors were encountered due to missing constraints and formatting mismatches.\n- Adjustments were made to align data formats and ensure referential integrity.\n- Some constraints, such as foreign key relationships, required modification to match real-world data inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Reporting Metrics\n\nTo generate actionable insights, we will focus on the following key metrics:\n\n### 5.1 Fundraising Performance\n- **Total funds raised per year** (trend over time)\n- **Top-performing fundraisers** (by revenue, donor count, and average donation)\n- **Fundraiser success rate** (number of fundraisers meeting revenue goals)\n\n### 5.2 Donor Engagement & Retention\n- **Donor retention rate** (percentage of repeat donors)\n- **New vs. returning donors per year**\n- **Distribution of donation amounts** (small vs. large donors)\n- **Largest single donations & largest cumulative donors**\n- **Contribution breakdown by donor type** (individual vs. corporate giving)\n\n### 5.3 Predictive Insights\n- **Year-over-year comparison of donor count & revenue**\n- **Seasonality trends** (best months/quarters for fundraising)\n- **Growth opportunities** (patterns in donor engagement that indicate potential areas for increased outreach)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Methodology & SQL Queries\n\nTo extract these insights, we will use SQL queries to analyze structured fundraising and donor data. The following queries will be implemented:\n\n1. **Total fundraising revenue per year**  \n2. **Structured vs. Unstructured Donations**\n3. **Fundraiser Type Effectiveness**\n4. **Donor retention rate (repeat donors vs. one-time donors)**  \n5. **Contribution breakdown by donor type (individual vs. corporate)**  \n6. **Distribution of donation amounts (how much do people typically give?)**  \n7. **Largest single donations & largest cumulative donors**  \n8. **Year-over-year comparison of donor count and revenue**  \n\nSQL queries were executed in Deepnote, retrieving data directly from Supabase PostgreSQL. Deepnote’s built-in visualization tools were used for straightforward charts, while Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) was leveraged for more advanced visualizations, such as the donor retention heatmap and Pareto analysis. Query results were structured into Pandas DataFrames where additional processing and formatting were necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 6.1 Total Fundraising Revenue Per Year\nTo analyze fundraising trends over time, we calculated total funds raised per year.\n\n\n","block_group":"89cdd9a612674df0b472d3da3d198284"},{"cellId":"dcb0a7598da649db8db4dedbcba7fdca","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"d6752214","execution_start":1743799258422,"execution_millis":1420,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","deepnote_table_state":{"sortBy":[],"filters":[],"pageSize":10,"pageIndex":0,"columnOrder":["year","total_raised"],"hiddenColumnIds":[],"columnDisplayNames":[],"conditionalFilters":[],"cellFormattingRules":[],"wrappedTextColumnIds":[]},"execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_table_loading":false,"deepnote_variable_name":"df_1","cell_id":"dcb0a7598da649db8db4dedbcba7fdca","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT

Total Fundraising Revenue Per Year\nDonations have declined dramatically in recent years. Fundraising peaked in 2019, reaching over $35,000, before plummeting to nearly nothing by 2024.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic likely contributed to the decline, the centers were only closed for a few months during the initial lockdowns. This suggests that additional factors—such as shifts in fundraising strategy, donor engagement, or organizational priorities—may have played a significant role in the drop. Understanding these factors is critical for rebuilding a sustainable fundraising model.\n\n#### Top-Performing Fundraisers\n\nThis query calculates both total revenue (gross) and net revenue for each fundraiser by subtracting associated costs.

analyzing the top-performing fundraisers, it’s important to identify and account for anomalies in the data.\n\nOne clear outlier is the \"Unprompted\" category, which represents donations received outside of any official fundraising campaign since 2005. Unlike other fundraisers, which have defined start and end dates, this category accumulates donations continuously over time, making direct comparisons misleading.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nIncluding this category inflates overall revenue totals and distorts fundraiser comparisons.\nIt does not represent an intentional fundraising effort with associated costs.\nTo accurately assess the effectiveness of fundraisers, this category should be excluded from certain performance comparisons.\n\n**Action Taken:**\n\nFor a clearer picture of fundraiser effectiveness, we exclude \"Unstructured Donations\" when analyzing fundraiser type performance and cost efficiency. However, it remains valuable as a benchmark for understanding the organization’s baseline donation income.\n\n### 6.2 Structured vs. Unstructured Donations\n\nWhile unstructured donations are not directly comparable to formal fundraisers, they still play a crucial role in MWPCCC’s financial health. By overlaying total unstructured donations with fundraiser performance over time, we aim to uncover trends such as:\n\n📊 Key Questions to Investigate:\n✅ Do unstructured donations increase in years where formal fundraising campaigns underperform?\n✅ Are there seasonal patterns in unstructured donations that align with fundraising efforts (e.g., year-end giving)?\n✅ Have major organizational events (such as leadership changes or external crises) influenced unstructured donations?\n✅ How much of MWPCCC’s annual fundraising revenue comes from unstructured giving vs. formal fundraising?\n\nNext Steps:\n\n📌 Generate a time-series visualization comparing annual unstructured donations with total fundraising revenue.\n📌 Analyze peaks and dips to determine whether formal fundraisers drive unstructured donations or whether they compete for donor attention.\n\nThis analysis compares direct, unprompted donations against structured fundraising events. Our findings indicate that while organized fundraisers bring in significant revenue, a notable portion of donations come from community members who contribute outside formal fundraising efforts.\n","block_group":"d2c5d86333b14e0c9c49947191dabb98"},{"cellId":"42f811028d7b42f395e21e723b2cf7bc","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"e70d6a41","execution_start":1743799261279,"execution_millis":1264,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","deepnote_table_state":{"sortBy":[],"filters":[],"pageSize":10,"pageIndex":1,"columnOrder":["year","total_fundraiser_revenue","total_unstructured_donations"],"hiddenColumnIds":[],"columnDisplayNames":[],"conditionalFilters":[],"cellFormattingRules":[],"wrappedTextColumnIds":[]},"execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_table_loading":false,"deepnote_variable_name":"df_4","cell_id":"42f811028d7b42f395e21e723b2cf7bc","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"WITH

analysis of structured vs. unstructured donations revealed key trends in MWPCCC’s fundraising history, pointing, in particular, to an outpouring of apparently spontaneous community giving early in the organization's history, followed by the rise of more structured outreach events. While unstructured donations — those given outside of formal fundraising efforts — were a consistent source of revenue, structured fundraisers became the primary means of engaging donors and driving targeted giving campaigns.\n\nHowever, not all fundraisers perform equally. Some fundraising types consistently generate higher revenue, attract more donors, or yield larger average donations than others.\n\nTo refine future fundraising strategies, we now turn to an analysis of fundraiser type effectiveness, evaluating which types have historically driven the greatest financial impact. By identifying the most successful fundraising formats, we can prioritize the approaches that maximize donor engagement and revenue generation.\n\n### 6.3 Fundraiser Type Effectiveness\n\nWhich fundraiser types generate the most revenue?

Accounting for Unique Fundraising Events\nOne particularly high-performing fundraiser in the Direct Donation category was the \"In Pat’s Memory\" campaign. Pat Griffith was one of MWPCCC’s founders—arguably *the* founder—who passed away in 2016. In the aftermath of her passing, the organization received a surge of memorial giving, totaling approximately $51,368.\n\nMemorial giving can be an important source of revenue, as it reflects a donor base deeply invested in the legacy and mission of an organization. However, this type of giving is inherently unpredictable—Pat Griffith will not pass away again, and a similar outpouring of support cannot be relied upon in future fundraising strategies.\n\nFor this reason, we have excluded \"In Pat’s Memory\" from our primary Direct Donation analysis to prevent it from skewing long-term trends. Instead, it will be examined separately to determine whether the donations were broad-based or concentrated among a few major donors.","block_group":"215af3def64346b3b4b73937db442866"},{"cellId":"c42fcbabc4f1412ab88fec747c034d15","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"1a238393","execution_start":1743799265269,"execution_millis":1170,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","deepnote_table_state":{"sortBy":[],"filters":[],"pageSize":10,"pageIndex":0,"columnOrder":["fundraiser_id","fundraiser_type","center","date_started","date_ended","total_donations","total_raised","average_donation"],"hiddenColumnIds":[],"columnDisplayNames":[],"conditionalFilters":[],"cellFormattingRules":[],"wrappedTextColumnIds":[]},"execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_table_loading":false,"deepnote_variable_name":"df_7","cell_id":"c42fcbabc4f1412ab88fec747c034d15","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT

Fundraising Success & the Power of Specific Goals vs. Consistent Efforts\n\nAmong the structured fundraisers analyzed, two distinct models of fundraising success emerged:\n\n1️⃣ The Noise Remediation Fundraiser – A highly successful, goal-driven fundraiser aimed at installing noise-canceling panels in the Infant Room at La Casita Verde (LCV). This event raised a large sum in a short period, supported by a mix of direct community donations and at least one grant from a local governing board.\n\n2️⃣ Cafe Wednesdays – A recurring small-scale fundraiser that took place approximately once a month over multiple years, eventually raising around $9,000. Unlike a high-impact one-time event, this fundraiser built revenue gradually through consistency and community engagement.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n📌 Specific, time-bound fundraisers with well-defined goals (e.g., facility improvements) seem to be particularly effective for mobilizing one-time and institutional donors.\n📌 Long-term, recurring fundraisers can generate meaningful revenue through sustained participation, even if individual events yield smaller contributions.\n📌 Diversification of fundraising methods—balancing strategic, high-impact fundraisers with regular, low-lift community engagement efforts—may be the best approach when it comes to successful fundraising.\n\nWhile analyzing fundraiser effectiveness helps us understand what strategies drive the most revenue, sustained financial stability depends not only on successful events but also on donor engagement over time. Fundraising efforts are most impactful when they cultivate long-term donor relationships, ensuring that supporters return year after year.\n\n🔍 Next, we examine donor retention trends—how frequently do donors contribute more than once, and what factors influence their continued support?\n\n### 6.4 Donor Retention Rate\n\nDonor retention rate measures how many donors give more than once, helping us assess long-term engagement. A high retention rate suggests a loyal donor base, while a low retention rate indicates challenges in maintaining relationships with donors.\n\n**Key Questions This Analysis Answers**\n✅ What percentage of Giving Entities (families, corporations, etc.) donate more than once?\n✅ Are donors engaging year after year, or are they one-time contributors?\n✅ How has donor retention changed over time?\n✅ What years had the strongest and weakest retention rates?","block_group":"ede0bb1255e74d43b7c075d83b1b7fbd"},{"cellId":"0eb417b24f6b46559e5a5c038be7501f","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"3ffdfd65","execution_start":1743799266552,"execution_millis":1193,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","deepnote_table_state":{"sortBy":[],"filters":[],"pageSize":10,"pageIndex":0,"columnOrder":["total_repeat_donors","total_donors","overall_retention_rate","donation_year","donors_this_year","returning_donors","yearly_retention_rate"],"hiddenColumnIds":[],"columnDisplayNames":[],"conditionalFilters":[],"cellFormattingRules":[],"wrappedTextColumnIds":[]},"execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_table_loading":false,"deepnote_variable_name":"df_3","cell_id":"0eb417b24f6b46559e5a5c038be7501f","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"WITH

1: Year-Over-Year Donor Retention Rate (Line Graph)**\nThis graph illustrates the percentage of donors who contributed in one year and returned to donate in subsequent years.\n\nThe retention rate remained relatively steady in previous years, fluctuating within a reasonable range.\n\nHowever, in 2020, we observe a drastic drop to 9.88%, meaning fewer than 1 in 10 previous donors returned to give again that year.\n\nGiven the timing, this sharp decline aligns with the COVID-19 pandemic, but it likely also reflects organizational challenges such as leadership turnover and a shift in fundraising focus.\n\nThis suggests that ongoing donor engagement efforts may have been deprioritized or disrupted at a crucial moment.\n","block_group":"5f9c1ca7578f40d7ac753f59350b6d8e"},{"cellId":"a2ec4d981f9b4d2a980cdbb04f917930","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"a2ec4d981f9b4d2a980cdbb04f917930","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"**Graph

retention plummeted in 2020, we see a surge in first-time donors that same year, with 81 new donors, compared to just 27 in 2019.\n\nHowever, this increase in new donors was not sustained—by 2021, the number of new donors fell back to just 8.\n\nThis suggests that while a one-time influx of support occurred in 2020, likely in response to the crisis, the organization was unable to convert these new donors into long-term supporters.\n\nHistorically, MWPCCC has maintained a healthy returning donor base (~33.4% of all donors), but the post-2020 period shows significant donor attrition.","block_group":"5f9c1ca7578f40d7ac753f59350b6d8e"},{"cellId":"4c7f6e1cde7e4a42b67d1f0f8b47c42b","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"4c7f6e1cde7e4a42b67d1f0f8b47c42b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"📊

donor retention is crucial for assessing the long-term financial stability of MWPCCC. Retaining donors over multiple years indicates sustained community engagement and reduces the cost of acquiring new donors. Our year-over-year retention rate analysis highlights key trends in donor behavior, while the cohort retention heatmap provides a visual representation of donor engagement over time.\n\n#### Key Findings:\n📉 **Significant Drop in Retention (2020)**\nThe retention rate dropped dramatically to 9.88% in 2020, suggesting a major decline in returning donors.\nWhile this coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, external factors such as leadership turnover and organizational turmoil likely contributed to fundraising disruptions.\n\n📊 **New Donor Spike (2020)**\nDespite the retention decline, 2020 saw a sharp increase in new donors, jumping from 27 donors in 2019 to 81 in 2020.\nHowever, this was not a lasting trend, as the number of donors fell back to 8 in both 2021 and 2022.\nThis suggests that while the community responded during a crisis, the organization did not effectively retain these new donors in the following years.\n\n📈 **Historical Donor Retention (Overall)**\nAcross the entire dataset, 33.4% of donors have been repeat donors.\nThis is a relatively strong retention rate, possibly reflecting deep community investment in the organization.\nHowever, the sharp decline in returning donors in 2020 and beyond may indicate a loss of trust, reduced outreach, or disengagement from the donor base.\n\n🌡 **Heatmap Insights: Declining Engagement in Recent Years**\nThe heatmap visualization reinforces these trends, showing a steep drop-off in return donors in recent years.\nEarlier cohorts maintained more stable engagement, whereas post-2020 donor retention has been weak.\n\n#### Implications for Fundraising Strategy:\n\n✅ Re-engagement Efforts Needed – Many donors who gave in 2020 did not return. Identifying and reconnecting with them could rebuild donor confidence.\n✅ Stronger Stewardship Programs – Retention rates suggest that targeted outreach and donor appreciation efforts could help sustain engagement.\n✅ Post-Pandemic Strategy Shift – The organization needs a renewed focus on long-term donor cultivation, beyond crisis-driven fundraising.\n\n### 6.5 Contribution Breakdown by Donor Type\n\nWhile donor retention provides insight into how consistently supporters give over time, understanding who these donors are is equally important. MWPCCC receives contributions from both individual donors and corporate entities, and analyzing this breakdown helps us refine fundraising strategies.\n\nBy examining the proportion of individual vs. corporate contributions, we can determine:\n\n1. Whether we rely more on grassroots community support or large institutional donors\n2. If there are opportunities to expand corporate partnerships or grow individual giving programs\n3. How donor type impacts fundraising stability and sustainability\n\nNext, we analyze the total contributions from individual and corporate donors to identify which donor group contributes the most and how this balance has shifted over time. We'll calculate the total amount donated by each donor type (individual vs. corporate) and their percentage share of overall contributions.","block_group":"a1b590948a634a5b87593aee0460c458"},{"cellId":"38d8b55dee7849d99c9371aa4f471844","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"9f567509","execution_start":1743799272769,"execution_millis":1232,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_variable_name":"df_8","cell_id":"38d8b55dee7849d99c9371aa4f471844","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT

Shifts in Donor Contribution Patterns Over Time\nThe data confirms that MWPCCC has historically relied on individual donors, which aligns with expectations—most contributions come from parents, alumni, and local community members rather than corporate sponsors.\n\nHowever, we see a small but notable spike in corporate and political giving in 2018 and 2019. This increase likely correlates with a concerted push for broader community fundraising, particularly tied to the Fun and Sun picnic events held in those years. These events seem to have successfully attracted local businesses, political figures, and larger-scale donors, indicating that community-driven, public-facing events can be effective in engaging a wider network of supporters.\n\nDespite this, corporate and political donations dropped off significantly after 2019, reinforcing the continued dominance of private, individual contributions. The trends suggest that MWPCCC has struggled to retain institutional support, potentially due to shifts in leadership, outreach strategies, or external economic pressures.\n\n##### Key Takeaways:\n📌 MWPCCC’s fundraising remains heavily reliant on individual donors – a strength for community engagement but a risk in terms of financial sustainability.\n📌 Corporate and political giving increased in 2018-2019 but was not sustained, suggesting that event-driven fundraising efforts have short-term benefits but lack long-term retention strategies.\n📌 Future fundraising efforts should consider a hybrid approach, leveraging community events to engage larger donors while implementing strategies to retain and grow corporate sponsorships over time.\n\n### 6.6 Distribution of Donation Amounts\n\nWhile understanding who contributes to MWPCCC’s fundraising efforts is essential, it is equally important to examine how much donors typically give. A deeper look at donation amounts over time can help identify key patterns:\n\n1. Are donations primarily small, recurring contributions, or do they rely on a few large gifts?\n2. Has the distribution of donation sizes changed over time?\n3. Are there any outliers or notable trends that could inform future fundraising strategies?\n\nBy analyzing the distribution of donation amounts, we can assess whether MWPCCC’s fundraising strategy has effectively diversified its donor base or if it remains overly dependent on high-value donors.\n\nTo analyze the distribution of donation amounts, we'll categorize donations into different size ranges. This will help us determine whether MWPCCC relies more on small, mid-sized, or large donations.","block_group":"6fe2ae59963440119d9d079eca6d1099"},{"cellId":"c6c197ab2de5415abfe203146caca6c5","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"6181b62b","execution_start":1743799275489,"execution_millis":1188,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_variable_name":"df_10","cell_id":"c6c197ab2de5415abfe203146caca6c5","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT \n    CASE \n        WHEN amount < 50 THEN 'Under $50'\n        WHEN amount >= 50 AND amount < 100 THEN '$50 -

A nonprofit’s financial health often depends on a mix of small, recurring donations and larger one-time contributions from key donors.\n\nIn this section, we examine:\n\n🔹 The largest single donations recorded in the database.\n🔹 The top cumulative donors, assessing whether their support has been consistent or occasional.\n\nIt’s important to note that all donor data has been anonymized to protect individual privacy. While the names presented here do not correspond to real individuals, the trends and insights remain fully representative of MWPCCC’s donor landscape.\n\nUnderstanding these trends can help MWPCCC build stronger relationships with major donors while ensuring a balanced fundraising strategy that doesn’t rely too heavily on a few key contributors.\n\nWe start with a SQL query to identify the largest single donations.","block_group":"6164ee60adb44c0a939ab3b5b963e50e"},{"cellId":"cb689e85d49f43eaba3423aec0304a1b","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"cda816","execution_start":1743799276789,"execution_millis":1118,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_variable_name":"df_11","cell_id":"cb689e85d49f43eaba3423aec0304a1b","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT donation_id, entity_id, occupant_full_name, amount, donation_date, fundraiser_id\nFROM donations\nORDER BY amount DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n"},"source":"df_11 = _dntk.execute_sql(\n  'SELECT donation_id, entity_id, occupant_full_name, amount, donation_date, fundraiser_id\\nFROM donations\\nORDER BY amount DESC\\nLIMIT 10;\\n',\n  'SQL_E4DCF937_C563_48B9_9A84_797D4F833EEA',\n  audit_sql_comment='',\n  sql_cache_mode='cache_disabled',\n  return_variable_type='dataframe'\n)\ndf_11","block_group":"d8dc9495c7c64eb3a866972b023962ec","execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.deepnote.sql-output-metadata+json":{"status":"success_no_cache","size_in_bytes":3474,"compiled_query":"SELECT donation_id, entity_id, occupant_full_name, amount, donation_date, fundraiser_id\nFROM donations\nORDER BY amount DESC\nLIMIT 10\n/* {\"app\":\"deepnote\",\"submitted_by\":\"user\",\"user_email\":\"sricasea@gmail.com\",\"workspace_id\":\"7d469830-b020-4998-9332-fad683944541\",\"project_id\":\"d50b48dc-8b60-4e72-885a-59c1190a91a3\",\"notebook_id\":\"870451d5ae6d45a5bca1bd2f825144ae\",\"project_url\":\"https://deepnote.com/project/d50b48dc-8b60-4e72-885a-59c1190a91a3\"} */;","variable_type":"dataframe","integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea"}},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":29,"data":{"application/vnd.deepnote.dataframe.v3+json":{"column_count":6,"row_count":10,"columns":[{"name":"donation_id","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":10,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"FAM0043-20180910-0001","count":1},{"name":"FAM0043-20201231-0001","count":1},{"name":"8 others","count":8}]}},{"name":"entity_id","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":1,"nan_count":1,"categories":[{"name":"FAM0043","count":9},{"name":"Missing","count":1}]}},{"name":"occupant_full_name","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":3,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"Milan Torres 1157","count":5},{"name":"Eden Taylor 1315","count":4},{"name":"Misc.

These donors have contributed approximately \\$10,000 annually for five years, with an additional \\$5,000 annually from another individual within the same entity. This level of giving suggests a deep connection to the organization, but it also raises concerns about dependency on a small number of major donors. Additionally, we found one large anonymous donation, highlighting gaps in historical donor tracking.\n\nTo further explore the impact of high-value donors, we will now examine cumulative donor contributions over time to see how many donors have provided significant long-term support.\n\nThis query will: \n✅ Sum all donations per donor (entity_id)\n✅ Rank donors by total contributions\n✅

How to Interpret This Chart:\nBars (blue): Show the absolute contribution amount of each top donor.\nLine (red): Shows the cumulative percentage of total donations contributed by these donors.\nDashed line at 80%: Helps determine how many donors make up 80% of all donations (Pareto Principle).\n\nThe Pareto principle (80/20 rule) suggests that a small percentage of donors contribute the majority of the funds. However, our initial analysis shows that even the top 10 donors only account for ~72% of total donations, meaning our fundraising structure may be more balanced than expected.\n\nTo gain a clearer picture of how MWPCCC's donor contributions are distributed, we will:\n1️⃣ Expand our analysis beyond the top 10 donors to see when (or if) the cumulative total reaches 80%.\n2️⃣ Assess whether mid-level and smaller donors contribute more than anticipated and identify potential fundraising opportunities.\n3️⃣ Determine if we are over-reliant on a few donors or if our donor base is more diversified than initially assumed.\n\nBy running this extended analysis, we aim to better understand the full distribution of donor contributions and identify where to focus future fundraising efforts.","block_group":"6ccf44493fa64ccbb5cbb30e8d9f9291"},{"cellId":"c669db94756b43a6a2c866aac217c118","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"5d3b2ce6","is_code_hidden":true,"execution_start":1743799281099,"execution_millis":1,"execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_app_is_code_hidden":true,"cell_id":"c669db94756b43a6a2c866aac217c118","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"#

Analysis: Concentration of Giving & Fundraising Sustainability\nThe Pareto analysis confirms that a small percentage of donors contribute the vast majority of total funds. Within the top 20 donors, we already reach the 80% cumulative contribution threshold, indicating a highly concentrated giving structure.\n\nThis suggests several key insights:\n\n1️⃣ Fundraising Risk & Sustainability\nMWPCCC relies heavily on a small group of major donors, meaning that even the loss of a few contributors could have a significant financial impact. This level of reliance underscores the need for long-term engagement strategies for high-value donors.\n\n2️⃣ Opportunities for Mid-Tier Growth\nWhile major donors carry much of the financial burden, mid-tier donors (giving between $100-$1,000) present an opportunity for growth. Expanding this segment could help reduce reliance on a few major contributors and increase financial stability.\n\n3️⃣ Strategic Donor Engagement\nThe organization should prioritize strengthening relationships with its top donors, ensuring continued support through personal outreach, tailored updates, and exclusive engagement opportunities. At the same time, efforts should be made to encourage mid-tier donors to increase their giving, possibly through tiered recognition programs, matching incentives, or more targeted donation requests.\n\n4️⃣ Cross-Referencing with Retention Data\nA critical next step is to analyze whether these top donors are repeat contributors or one-time givers. If most of them are returning donors, retention efforts should focus on maintaining engagement over time. If many are one-time givers, this may indicate missed stewardship opportunities and a need for more effective post-donation follow-up.\n\n#### Key Takeaway:\nMWPCCC’s funding structure is heavily reliant on a small number of major donors, making long-term engagement crucial. However, mid-tier donors represent an opportunity for financial diversification, and targeted efforts should be made to both retain top donors and cultivate stronger mid-level giving.\n\n### 6.8 Quantifying the Decline in Donor Support\nThe previous sections have made one fact clear: MWPCCC’s donor base has been shrinking, and overall giving has declined in recent years. Major gifts have helped sustain operations, but the loss of recurring donors and small contributions presents a serious challenge to long-term financial stability.\n\nHere, we take a closer look at the numbers to quantify this decline more precisely. Instead of asking whether donor participation and revenue have fallen, we now ask:\n\n1. How steep is the decline year-over-year?\n2. At what point did donor engagement and giving peak, and how sharp was the drop-off?\n3. Are these shifts consistent across all donor types, or are certain segments more affected?\n4. What does this trend suggest about MWPCCC’s fundraising resilience and potential strategies for rebuilding support?\n\nThis analysis will provide a clear, data-driven foundation for future fundraising strategy, ensuring that MWPCCC can develop targeted solutions to counteract declining donor participation and revenue.\n","block_group":"5d1695320919410f9bff3e12690ce92b"},{"cellId":"af5ec7866abf4d1899150bde7d16d329","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"af5ec7866abf4d1899150bde7d16d329","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"**SQL

data reveals that the decline in donor count has been steeper than the decline in total donations, suggesting that donor retention efforts have helped sustain revenue despite a shrinking donor base. Additionally, we see that the peak in donations occurred a year before the peak in donor count, which could indicate that major donors contributed heavily before overall engagement began to decline.\n\nAnother key factor to consider is the historical approach to fundraising at MWPCCC. In previous years, individual centers operated their own fundraisers, fostering a steady stream of contributions. However, in an effort to reduce internal competition and improve staff morale, administrative leadership has moved toward centralizing fundraising efforts. This shift—while well-intentioned—has not yet resulted in a clear alternative fundraising strategy.\n\nTo further contextualize the decline in fundraising revenue, we examined how often MWPCCC has actively fundraised over the years. A high volume of fundraisers might indicate strong engagement efforts, whereas a lower frequency could suggest periods of inactivity or shifting organizational priorities.","block_group":"e9cadc7ee9eb4fb6b36a3af852705699"},{"cellId":"abbc5d4b2dfc4b4c9475f810a17354bb","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"6903dfee","execution_start":1743799286599,"execution_millis":1155,"sql_integration_id":"e4dcf937-c563-48b9-9a84-797d4f833eea","execution_context_id":"c834ce55-85f1-45cc-b6f0-1527eb456656","deepnote_variable_name":"df_16","cell_id":"abbc5d4b2dfc4b4c9475f810a17354bb","deepnote_cell_type":"sql","deepnote_sql_source":"SELECT

Analysis: Year-Over-Year Donor & Revenue Trends\nThe number of fundraisers per year has followed a steady decline, mirroring the downward trend in donor engagement and total revenue.\n\nThe busiest fundraising years coincided with the organization’s highest revenue totals, suggesting that consistent fundraising efforts directly impact financial success.\n\nThe sharp drop-off in fundraiser count in recent years aligns with the steep decline in donations—put simply, when MWPCCC stopped asking, donors stopped giving.\n\nWhile external factors, like the pandemic and shifts in organizational leadership, likely played a role, the data suggests that proactive fundraising efforts matter more than we might have realized.\n\n💡 Key Takeaway:\nFundraising isn’t just about getting lucky with a few generous donors—it requires consistent effort and engagement. The data makes one thing clear: when MWPCCC made fundraising a priority, donors responded. If we want to restore financial stability, we need to reinvest in active, strategic fundraising efforts.\n\n#### Next Steps & Recommendations\n1. **Reassess the current fundraising strategy:** Given that decentralization previously led to more frequent and successful fundraising efforts, a hybrid approach may be worth considering.\n2. **Strengthen donor outreach:** Donors who continue to give despite declining engagement are valuable assets—targeted donor appreciation and retention strategies could help sustain giving levels.\n3. **Increase fundraising visibility:** Ensure that fundraising remains an active and consistent part of MWPCCC’s communication and engagement efforts, rather than an afterthought.","block_group":"0d1581e716dc4c3293fc12dc3465e457"},{"cellId":"74fe802c74c64bac828f91617f3fa59c","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"74fe802c74c64bac828f91617f3fa59c","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Summary & Key Takeaways\nMWPCCC’s donor and fundraising data reveal a complex but clear pattern: fundraising efforts have been inconsistent, and donor engagement has declined in recent years. The steep drop in fundraising revenue, particularly after 2019, coincided with a decline in structured fundraising events and shifts in organizational priorities.\n\nHowever, our analysis has uncovered some crucial insights that can help shape future strategy:\n\n📌 **Donor Retention Matters:** Before 2020, about one-third of all donors returned for additional contributions—a solid base of support. But in 2020, retention dropped dramatically, suggesting that external factors (such as COVID-19 and leadership turnover) played a role in donor disengagement.\n\n📌 **Fundraising Works—When It Happens:** Fundraisers with clear goals and community involvement, like the Noise Remediation Fundraiser, performed exceptionally well. In contrast, years with little structured fundraising saw lower engagement and revenue. The takeaway? You don’t get donations if you don’t ask for them.\n\n📌 **Small Consistent Giving is a Big Deal:** While major donors made up the bulk of our total fundraising revenue, the most common donation amount was between \\$100 and \\$249—a range accessible to many community members. Encouraging recurring or mid-range donations could help stabilize fundraising income.\n\n📌 **The Risk of Relying on a Few Big Donors:** Our Pareto analysis showed that a small percentage of donors have historically carried the bulk of our fundraising success. While this generosity is invaluable, it also makes the organization vulnerable to financial instability if just a few key donors stop giving.\n\n## Moving Forward\nThe good news? We have data to guide better decision-making. By focusing on structured, engaging fundraisers, improving donor retention efforts, and making it easier for community members to contribute at sustainable levels, MWPCCC can rebuild a stronger fundraising foundation.\n\nAnd on that note…\n\n🌟 **Want to be part of the next success story?** 🌟\nDonate to MWPCCC today and join my dataset!
