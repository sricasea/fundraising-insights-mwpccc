# 📊 Fundraising Insights for MWPCCC

This project explores 15+ years of donor and fundraising data for Mt. Washington Preschool and Child Care Center (MWPCCC), a nonprofit early childhood organization in Los Angeles. 

Using SQL, Python, and data visualization tools, I analyzed donor engagement, fundraiser performance, and long-term sustainability trends. The goal: provide actionable insights to support financial stability and strategic planning during a time of organizational transition.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- **Structured raw donor data** from Google Sheets into a relational PostgreSQL database
- **Wrote and documented SQL queries** to uncover key fundraising metrics (top fundraisers, retention, donation distribution, etc.)
- **Visualized trends** in Deepnote using Python, Seaborn, and built-in SQL visual tools
- **Identified financial outliers** and proposed future fundraising strategies
- **Told the story behind the data**, connecting trends to real-world context (COVID, staffing, leadership turnover)

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

- How much has MWPCCC raised over time?
- Which fundraisers were most successful—and why?
- What percentage of donors are one-time vs. recurring?
- Are large donations carrying too much weight?
- How have giving patterns changed over time?

## 🧵 Background

MWPCCC faced a steep drop in fundraising revenue in the years following COVID-19, despite recovering enrollment. This project emerged as part of my pro bono data internship with the board, where I led the creation of a comprehensive fundraising analysis to support decision-making during a financial crossroads.
